## Mechanical Aspect Of Design

### Chasis
  It is an sauare shaped base, 3 caster wheeled  drive bot that can be easily manufactured. 

### Material
  The chassis is made Wood. It reduces the overall weight of the bot and hence reducing the load on motors.

### Motor Assembly
  Two Stepper motors are used, to get the required force. The shaft of the motor is passed through printed couplings. 
  And the servo motor is attached at the middle of the chasis.

### Pen holder
  It is a 3D printed cylindrical holder that is placed at the center of the chassis. It can hold only one pen at a time and the size of the holder is fixed and hence the pen diameter is fixed.

### Wings
  For the ease of the traversal of the thread two wings are attched at the front side of the bot.They are attached to the chasis.

## Electronics Aspect Of Design

### Code Algorithm
  All actuations are done with appropriate velocities which are calculated by the gcode line.
  after uploading the arduino code upload the gcode file through the processing software through the same port.

### Micro-controller
  Arduino Mega 2560 R3 is used as the microcontroller board.

### Actuators
  Stepper motors are used for traversal actuation of bot which is controlled by Cytron motor driver.
  servo motor ae used for the traversal of the Pen Holder.

### Power Source
 *  11.1V LiPo battery is used as the power source.
 * Motors are directly powered from the battery.
 * Arduino Mega board is powered with ac to DC converter .

## Applications

Plotting any Image on the smooth wall.

## Limitations

*  Particular size of pen can only be used.
*  It can plot only in single colour.
*  it cannot draw on rough surfaces.

## Future Improvements

*  install a spring in the pen system so that it can draw on rough surfaces to.
*  installation of bluetooth .
