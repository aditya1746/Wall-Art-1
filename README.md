* 1x Servo motors.
* 2x Cytron motor drivers.
* 1x Arduino Mega.
* 2x 3dprinted pulleys.
* 2x Couplings
* 1x Full Bread board.
* Jumper wires.
* Wodden square channels+plates.
* 1x Pen.
* shuttle bat string.
* 3x Caster wheels

## Mechanical Aspect Of Design

1.  It's a 3 wheeled drive bot which can sketch any curve given to it. 
2.  The chasis is made of wooden square plate having 3 holes for Caster wheels in design. 
3.  Motor and the pulleys are attached together with couplings. 
4.  wheels are placed as 2 in front half and 1 in back half of chasis. 
5.  Pen is placed in middle with the help of 3d printed cylindrical part.

## Electronics Aspect Of Design

1.  Stepper motors are controlled by Cytron motor drivers which is powered directly from  .

## Applications

Plotting any Image on any scale of canvas.

## Limitations

*  Particular size of pen can only be used.
*  It can plot only in single colour.

## Future Improvements

*  Attaching a servo motor for rising pen up to plot discontinuous curves.
